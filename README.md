# Node Backend for Disclose

Backend service for handling request from the android app and the frontend web app. 

## Requirements
- NodeJS (runtime)
- MongoDB (database)
- NPM (package management)

## Usage

MongoDB needs to be running in the background. Eventually, we'll provision a former mongodb instance on the VM. For now, just run mongo in another terminal.

```
mongod
```

Finally, for running the application itself.

```
npm install
bin/www
```
